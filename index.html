        <h2>What is race?</h2>
        <p>Race is a loosely defined classification of people based on key physical characteristics and/or geographic
            ancestry. In the past, blatant racism was rampant in the healthcare industry as it was in every other part
            of US society. Much of this was based on the misconception of what race means. The main misconception
            centers around the idea that race is biological, meaning that it determines someone's specific genetic
            makeup. This lead to different people receiving different treatment based on race as it was believed that
            different races would react differently to certain treatments. However, studies have shown this is not the
            case it is not possible to determine someone's race with complete accuracy based on their DNA. There is just
            as much genetic diversity among people of the same race as there are among people of different races. This
            effectively makes race a social construct and therefore, its implications are not biological but based on
            society how we think about race. Although not as blatant as in the past the idea that there are distinct
            biological differences in people based on race still leads to many biases by healthcare workers today.

        <h2>Race-Based Medicine</h2>

        <p>Race-based medicine is applied in two ways. The first is the assumption that race is genetic, therefore
            believing that one racial group is more likely to get a disease or have a different reaction to something
            solely based on their race. The second-way race based medicine is applied, is by using race as a proxy to
            determine other factors about an individual, such as their environment, ancestry, and social status. This is
            still a bad use for medicine because although one race might be more likely to have a certain factor there
            are still many variants of people's environment and lifestyle within the same race, so it would be much
            better to ask about those other factors more specifically.

        <br>
        <p>An example of this is in the estimate glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). This rate is used to determine the
            health of someone's kidneys. This rating is therefore important when it comes to kidney transplants and
            other treaments. The GFR is determined based on the amount of creatine in someone's bloodstream but people
            with different characteristics and lifestyles will naturally have different levels of creatine too. To get
            around this medical professionals account for race, sex, age, and other factors into the score. Since black
            people on average have higher creatine levels they are automatic given a higher score than a non-hispanic
            white person with the same concentration of creatine. This is a clear example of using race as a bad proxy,
            because racial groups represent millions of people with vastly different experiences and lifestyles. Making
            assumptions based on the average a very large number of people is obviously going to be representive of
            every person in that particualr group. The danger with practices such as this is that it harms both sides as
            a black person that could really need the transplant is not given the priority simply for being black. As
            mention before a better method would be to simply ask about the lifestyle factors specifically instead of
            using race as the proxy since race is only a social construct, it is not an accurate determinant of an
            indivisuals life. </p>

            <div id="asian_edu_chart">
                <h4>Asian Americans Highest Level of Euducation</h4>
            </div>
            <div id="everyone_edu_chart">
                <h4>All Americans Highest Level of Education</h4>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>The charts above illustrate the level of variance there are among people of the same race is a similar amount
            of variance among the education level of adult Asian Americans are there among all Americans as a whole.
            This proves that simply trying to make assumptions about an individual based on their race could lead to
            inaccurate results</p>
        <h2>Racism</h2>
        <p>So far I have discussed why race is a social construct and why is a bad proxy for other information about a
            person's life for medical professionals. This still begs the question of why there are is such a big
            discrepancy between the health outcomes of people of different races? The answer boils down to racism and
            social policies that have impacted different groups in different ways for decades. Many of these practices
            include redlining, policing, education, white flight, and the prison system, which have all played a role in
            upholding white supremacy and forced a large number of black people to be stuck in a cycle of poverty. These
            poverty-stricken areas have more pollution, fewer resources, and are a more stressful environment to live
            in, thus all contribute to worse outcomes for people living there.</p>
        <p>In the end, with race itself not being the reason why certain people are more likely to have a certain health
            outcome and with the role that racism has played in determining people's environment and access to
            resources, it is apparent that race does not have an impact on health instead racism does.</p>
